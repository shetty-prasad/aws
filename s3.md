## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

* S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable, available, secure, and high-performance object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* In simple terms, S3 functions like a cloud-based storage service similar to Dropbox or Google Drive, but with the extensive capabilities and integration of AWS.
* S3 is an object-based storage system, meaning it stores complete objects (files) with their metadata.

  * S3 is ideal for storing:
    * Application log files
    * Media assets such as images, videos, and audio files
    * Artifacts generated from CI/CD pipelines

* Buckets
  * Buckets are the containers in S3 where objects (files) are stored. Think of a bucket as a folder that groups related files.
  *  **Bucket name has to be unique across AWS.**

* Objects
  * An object in S3 consists of the file data and its metadata. Each object includes:
    * A key: a unique name for the file.
    * A value: the actual data of the file.
    * Additional properties such as version ID and metadata (if versioning is enabled).

* Flat File Structure
  * S3 utilizes a flat file structure, meaning there is no inherent concept of nested directories. While the AWS console may visually display folder-like groupings using prefixes, the underlying storage remains flat. For example, uploading files with keys like "music/song_one", "music/song_two", and "music/song_three" creates the illusion of a "music" folder.

* Data Durability and Availability
  * When you upload a file to S3, AWS replicates it across multiple servers and availability zones. This replication ensures high durability and availability, protecting your data even if a server or entire availability zone fails.

* S3 Restrictions
  * S3 can store an unlimited number of objects.
  * The maximum size for a single object is 5 terabytes.
  * By default, each AWS account can create up to 100 buckets. This limit can be increased up to 1,000 by requesting a service limit increase.
