#### VPC

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a secure, isolated section of AWS where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPCs enable you to isolate resources, ensuring that one customer's data remains separate from another's—even within the same AWS account—and allow you to securely segment different applications.
