#### VPC

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a secure, isolated section of AWS where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPCs enable you to isolate resources, ensuring that one customer's data remains separate from another's—even within the same AWS account—and allow you to securely segment different applications.
- A VPC is specific to a single region .
- By design, resources within one VPC are isolated from those in another. To enable communication with the internet or between VPCs, you must explicitly configure the necessary settings, adding an extra layer of security.
