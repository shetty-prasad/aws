How I’d explain designing a new AWS cloud system — interview-ready answer

Say this out loud in a clear structure: context → constraints → high-level design → components & decisions → non-functional requirements → rollout & operations. Interviewers want to hear your thought process, tradeoffs, and the artifacts you’d deliver. Below is a concise script + checklist and a whiteboard walkthrough you can use in an interview.

1) Opening / context (30–45s)

Start by framing the problem:

“First I’d confirm the goals and constraints: what business capabilities must the system deliver, who are the users, expected load and growth rate, latency and availability targets, data classification and compliance requirements, existing on-prem systems to integrate or migrate, and budget/time constraints. From there I pick an architecture pattern aligned to those constraints.”

This shows you don’t design in a vacuum.

2) Ask the interviewer clarifying, high-impact questions (say 4–6)

(You don’t need to actually ask in a phone screen — say you would.)

What are the primary SLAs/SLIs (RTO/RPO, availability %, latency)?

Expected traffic profile (peak requests/sec, steady state, seasonal spikes)?

Data sensitivity / compliance (PCI, HIPAA, GDPR)?

Multi-region requirement or single region OK?

Integration points (databases, partner APIs, identity providers)?

Budget or cost ceiling? Time to production?

Mentioning these shows you’re pragmatic and risk-aware.

3) High-level architecture pattern (60–90s)

Pick one and justify it (example: web application microservices):

“I’d design a multi-account, multi-tier architecture: separate accounts for Identity, Security/Audit, Logging, Shared Services, Prod, and Non-Prod using AWS Organizations. Use an API/gateway + stateless microservices layer for business logic, backed by managed data services (RDS/Aurora for relational, DynamoDB for low-latency KV, S3 for object store). Use private VPCs, transit (Transit Gateway) or AWS Cloud WAN for networking, and edge caching via CloudFront. All infrastructure is provisioned via IaC (Terraform or CDK) with pipelines for CI/CD, and observability centralized in the Security/Audit account.”

Always tie choices to requirements (e.g., choose Aurora for strong RDBMS needs, DynamoDB for scale/low latency).

4) Key design components & decisions (explain each briefly)
Identity & Access

Centralize with AWS Identity Center or external IdP (Okta/Azure AD).

Use roles and short-lived STS credentials, no long-lived keys.

Enforce MFA and ABAC where appropriate.

Multi-account strategy & governance

AWS Organizations + SCPs for guardrails.

Control Tower or Landing Zone as baseline if needed.

Permissions boundaries for delegated IAM admin tasks.

Networking

Separate VPCs per account or per environment with Transit Gateway/Transit VPC.

Use private subnets for compute, NAT for outbound, VPC endpoints for AWS APIs.

Use Security Groups + NACLs + PrivateLink for service isolation.

Compute

Prefer serverless where apt: Lambda + API Gateway for event-driven or spiky workloads.

Use ECS/Fargate or EKS for containerized microservices requiring fine-grained control.

Use Auto Scaling for resilience and cost optimization.

Data

Choose managed DBs: Aurora (Postgres/MySQL) for relational, DynamoDB for massive scale, S3 for durable object storage with lifecycle policies.

KMS for encryption keys; separate key per environment/account with key policies.

Data replication and backups: cross-region replication if DR needed.

Integration & Messaging

Event-driven: EventBridge or SNS/SQS for decoupling.

Stream processing: Kinesis or MSK for real-time streams.

Security & Compliance

Centralize logs: CloudTrail organization trail to logging account; VPC Flow Logs; ALBs logs to S3.

Runtime protection: GuardDuty, Security Hub, AWS Config rules, Inspector.

WAF & Shield for public endpoints; API Gateway rate limiting.

Secrets via Secrets Manager or Parameter Store with rotation.

Observability & Ops

Metrics & logs into CloudWatch (or Prometheus + Grafana for metrics).

Centralized tracing with X-Ray or OpenTelemetry.

SRE playbooks, runbooks, health checks, and alerting thresholds.

CI/CD & Automation

GitOps model: pipelines per microservice (CodePipeline/GitHub Actions/CodeBuild).

Automated IaC testing: linting, plan/apply gates, policy-as-code checks (e.g., terraform-compliance, cfn-nag).

Canary / blue-green deployments for zero-downtime.

Resilience & DR

Multi-AZ by default; multi-region for critical systems.

Backup cadence aligned with RPO/RTO (RDS snapshots, S3 cross-region replication).

Disaster runbook and periodic DR drills.

Cost & Monitoring

Rightsize compute, use savings plans or reserved instances where appropriate.

Use Cost Explorer & budgets; tagging strategy for chargeback.

5) Example whiteboard walkthrough (narrative you can speak while drawing)

Draw 3 columns: Users (Internet, Mobile App), Edge (CloudFront + WAF), Core (API GW → Load Balancer → ECS/EKS/Lambda), Data (Aurora, DynamoDB, S3), Integration (EventBridge, SQS), Observability (CloudWatch, X-Ray), Security & Identity (IdP + IAM + KMS), Networking (VPCs & Transit Gateway).

Walk the request flow: user → CloudFront/WAF → API Gateway → Service (ECS/Fargate) → DB or S3; events published to EventBridge; async jobs consumed from SQS; results returned; traces flow to X-Ray; logs and CloudTrail go to centralized logging account.

Call out controls: TLS everywhere, KMS encryption, least-privilege roles, SCPs, PrivateLink for third-party access, and VPC endpoints to avoid internet egress.

This shows clarity and communication skills.

6) Tradeoffs & rationale (say 3–4 examples)

Serverless vs containers: Serverless reduces ops but may have cold start and concurrency limits. Choose serverless for event-driven, containers for long-running processes or complex dependencies.

Single region vs multi-region: Multi-region improves resilience but increases complexity and cost; choose it only if SLA requires it.

Managed services vs self-managed: Managed services (Aurora, RDS, MSK) speed delivery and reduce ops; self-managed may be needed for specialized configs.

Showing tradeoffs proves architectural maturity.

7) Deliverables you’d produce

High-level architecture diagram and component list.

Security & compliance plan (controls, encryption, logging).

IaC repo skeleton + sample pipeline.

Operational runbooks, SLO/SLI definitions, and DR plan.

Cost estimate & tagging strategy.

Mentioning artifacts shows you deliver usable outputs, not just diagrams.

8) Rollout plan & validation

Start with a pilot (greenfield microservice or proof-of-concept in non-prod).

Validate security, performance, compliance, and cost.

Iterate with feedback and run performance/load tests.

Ramp to production with staged rollout and feature flags.

Post-launch: runbook handoff, run regular audits, and optimize.

9) How you’d close the answer (strong finish)

“In short, I’d design with separation of concerns (multi-account), least privilege, managed services, and automation for repeatability. I’d validate with a small pilot, iterate with telemetry, and codify everything in IaC and runbooks so the system is secure, observable, cost-efficient, and resilient.”

That closing line ties together the principles.
